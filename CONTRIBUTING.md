   cd oracle-cli
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install in development mode**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

5. **Create a branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Code Style

This project follows PEP 8 guidelines. You can check your code with:

```bash

black oracle_cli/

# Type checking
mypy oracle_cli/
```

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add SQL query export feature

## Styleguides

### Python Styleguide

* Follow PEP 8
* Use type hints where possible
* Maximum line length: 100 characters
* Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
* Use f-strings for string formatting

Example:
```python
def fetch_table_data(
    conn: oracledb.Connection,
    schema: str,
    table_name: str,
    limit: int = 100
) -> List[Tuple]:
    """
    Fetch data from a table.
    
    Args:
        conn: Active Oracle database connection
        schema: Schema name containing the table
        table_name: Name of the table to query
        limit: Maximum number of rows to fetch
        
    Returns:
        List of tuples containing table rows
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If table name is invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use Markdown for documentation
* Keep lines under 80 characters when possible
* Use code blocks with language specification
* Include examples where appropriate

## Testing Guidelines

* Write tests for all new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for high code coverage
* Use descriptive test names

Example:
```python
def test_describe_table_returns_columns():
    """Test that describe_table returns expected column structure."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```
